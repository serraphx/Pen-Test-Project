## Vulnerability Research

For this part of your lab you will list the vulnerabilities you found across all hosts which are rated as high (ignore the medium and low), and research them through the OpenVAS, CVE, and NVD databases. 

Using the information in gvm and the CVE and NVD databases research the HIGH vulnerabilities you have found.  Complete the table below based on your research.
