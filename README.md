# Penetration Testing and Incident Response Term Project

## Description
This term project takes a scenario of a start-up called Happy Accident Labs, that is developing miniature Internet of Things (IoT) devices, called "smarticle particles," that serve as personal assistants. Concerned about the security of their intellectual property, an investor has requested a black-box penetration test of the company's internal network, specifically within the IP range 10.19.99.1 - 10.19.99.99. This project details the steps that were taken, tools utilized, and reports that were submitted.
